		      		Hello! My name is Ashlyn O'Hara and I'm excited to welcome you to my digital portfolio. 
		      		<br><br>
					In May I will graduate with honors from the University of Missouri School of Journalism with a Bachelor of Journalism in Data Journalism. I currently work at The Columbia Missourian as an advanced statehouse reporter, which I am doing <img class="about_embeds" src="https://i.imgur.com/FQLu2mZ.jpg">for the second session in a row because I love it so much. I also work on the graphics desk, where I help reporters visualize their stories in addition to pitching and creating my own data visualizations using Adobe Illustrator, Tableau and Flourish.studio software. 
					<br><br>
					I transferred to the University of Missouri in Fall of 2018 from the Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School in New York City, where I studied Journalism + Design and Politics. Living in New York City was one of the best adventures of my life. I am originally from sunny San Diego, California, <img class="about_embedsl" src="https://i.imgur.com/U3VAuBJ.mp4">and have always had an obsession with big cities. As a child I treasured family trips to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and always knew that when I grew up I wanted to move somewhere big. 
					<br><br>
					I've been working as a reporter since I was 16 and have made the most of every experience journalism affords me. I've followed U.S. Senate Candidates on the campaign trail, conducted interviews from the middle of the Missouri River and been embeded in the militant occupation of school spaces by students. 
					<br><br>
					In my free time, you can find me on long drives in my Toyota Prius, binge-watching documentaries with my kitten Linda, or making vegan pancakes and fruit smoothies. I am currently based in the midwest, but after my graduation from college in a few weeks, I am willing to relocate anywhere in the United States. 
					<br><br>
					Take a look around and reach out to me with questions, comments, or book recommendations!
