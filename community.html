		      	<p class="subhead">I have over three years of hyperlocal community reporting experience. From 2015 to 2017, I was a reporting intern at <i>Our Hometown Magazine</i> in my hometown of Chula Vista, California (south San Diego County). My work ranged from writing profiles of community members, to crafting feature stories, to writing community news stories. 
		      	<br><br>
		      	At <i>The Columbia Missourian</i>, I worked as a public life reporter (while also covering the 2018 midterm election) in the city of Columbia, Missouri. As a public life reporter, I covered city council meetings, wrote feature stories about local events and wrote about different city and county elections.
